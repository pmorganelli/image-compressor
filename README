Each file contains functions for both compressing and decompressing in 
parrallel steps, which allows modules to share secrets about certain steps
in the compression/decompression process.

1. readOrWrite.c
        a. This file is responsible for trimming the file and writing 
           the contents to disk. On the decompression side, it reads the 
           compressed file 
2. transformPixels.c
        a. This file provides functions to convert pixels from an RGB 
           representation to component video representations and back. It also
           exports the populateCv and populateRgb functions, the first of
           which we use in the wordConversions module to reconstruct a cv array
3. wordConversions.c
        a. This file is responsible for converting 2x2 blocks to a 32-bit word
           and 2x2 blocks to a 32-bit word.
3. packOrUnpack.c
        a. This file is responsible for packing 32-bit words and unpacking 
           32-bit words using the bitpack interface. It is used by the 
           wordConversions module and keeps the secret of what order the values
           in the codeword are stored in.
