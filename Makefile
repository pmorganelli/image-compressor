# Makefile for arith (Comp 40 Assignment 4)
# 
# Includes build rules for a2test and ppmtrans.
#
# This Makefile is more verbose than necessary.  In each assignment
# we will simplify the Makefile using more powerful syntax and implicit rules.

############## Variables ###############

CC = gcc # The compiler being used

# Updating include path to use Comp 40 .h files and CII interfaces
IFLAGS = -I/comp/40/build/include -I/usr/sup/cii40/include/cii

# Compile flags
# Set debugging information, allow the c99 standard,
# max out warnings, and use the updated include path
# CFLAGS = -g -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -pedantic $(IFLAGS)
# 
# For this assignment, we have to change things a little.  We need
# to use the GNU 99 standard to get the right items in time.h for the
# the timing support to compile.
# 
CFLAGS = -g -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -pedantic $(IFLAGS)

# Linking flags
# Set debugging information and update linking path
# to include course binaries and CII implementations
LDFLAGS = -g -L/comp/40/build/lib -L/usr/sup/cii40/lib64

# Libraries needed for linking
# All programs cii40 (Hanson binaries) and *may* need -lm (math)
# arith40 is a catch-all for this assignment, netpbm is needed for pnm

# Collect all .h files in your directory.
# This way, you can never forget to add
# a local .h file in your dependencies.
#
# This bugs Mark, who dislikes false dependencies, but
# he agrees with Noah that you'll probably spend hours 
# debugging if you forget to put .h files in your 
# dependency list.

############### Rules ###############
